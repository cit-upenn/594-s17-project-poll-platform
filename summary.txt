Project Description:

Name: Poll Platform

Primary Functions: 

This is a web application built in Spring MVC framework. It provides a user with a platform to launch his or her polls and fill out polls launched by others. It can:
- give users convenient access to the processed poll results by displaying histogram charts
- generate recommended polls for each user based on his or her habits
- track the user's points, i.e. users will earn points by filling out polls and cost points to publish polls. 

The platform also maintains an apache Derby database to store user and poll information.
